# Faial Community Day

One of my favourite things about living in Pico, is that it's a part of an archipelago of nine islands - each with their unique energy, landscape, and opportunities. **Each island is a world, and together they form a galaxy.**

I've recently had a pleasure to facilitate a **community weaving workshop** in Pico's closest neighbour - Faial island. This marks a significant step on the journey towards co-creating [Azores Regenerative Network](azores-regenerative-network.md).

Here's a part of the invitation:

>The word "community" can mean many different things. It can be challenging to align on a shared vision. And it can be even more challenging to actually work together and manifest our dreams. Yet, it's hard to shake off the feeling that **creating together is not only more effective but also more fun**. How could we do it effectively, given the context of our beautiful island?
>
> The intention of this gathering is to **get practical and move our collective energy forward**. 

## The Workshop

Here's the outline:

1. Check in: *how are you feeling? why are you here?*
2. Theory: different community models; microsolidarity 101
3. Sharing: lessons from two years of implementing microsolidarity in Pico
4. Lunch break
5. Practice: [Community Council](https://michalkorzonek.com/community-council) - round of mapping & round of calls
6. Check out: *how are you feeling? what are you taking away?*

I've delivered the workshop using *Cards* - an analogue collaborative meta game I've been developing over the last two years, inspired by [Zettlekasten method](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/) and "*The Game*" which I've been introduced to a few years back while living in [Astralship](https://astralship.org).

*After the cards are ready, it's time to organise them into decks.*

Note: Here are the [milestones](congregation/milestones.md) of our congregation.

### Community Council
[Community Council](https://michalkorzonek.com/community-council) is a modular community catalysing game. In this iteration we played two rounds.

**Round of Mapping** showcased a few of the projects/crews open for participation that already exist in the island.

A wonderful moment occurred when one of the participants asked if there's a Tai Chi group in the island, and that was the project that was just about to be placed on the map.

**Round of Calls** resulted in calling 8 projects, with 6 of them receiving enough energy to begin. The next step is for the callers to reach out to people on the "List of Connections" to arrange the kick-off meeting.

**The main intention is to experiment with crewing and begin to build trust.** The success of the project is a secondary objective.

The group also committed to **have a retrospective in three months** to reconnect and check on their progress.

## Reflections
- **Despite of my emphasis on the importance of building trust within the entire congregation, none of the projects called aimed to bring *all* of the group together.** I'm considering tweaking the next iteration of Community Council for new proto-congregations to include a form of a sharing circle in order for the group to experience this format. On the other hand, building trust in small crews is also a very effective trust-building strategy, and the group committed to come back together for a retrospective.
- **10 adults and 2 children attended the workshop**. One of the adults played with the children during the entire workshop. Note: Integrating children into "more adulty" activities is one of the challenges we are exploring in our [Pico Community Gatherings](/projects/gatherings.md).
- We begun the workshop 30 minutes late, which resulted in skipping one of the planned activities. **The punctuality-sensitivity is always a challenge in multicultural groups.**
- **The workshop was funded by donations** with the explicit suggestion on the invitation: €15-65. We found €195 in the jar, which after covering the expenses was distributed between the facilitator, organiser, child carer, and the owner of the venue.
- Fun fact: apparently one person decided not to show up because of the word "catalyst" I used to describe myself in the event invitation. Similarly, the signature "Love and Light" repelled another couple. This reflects the **two-fold purpose of the invitation: to attract people and to repel people.** At the end, whoever shows up is the "right" person to be in the room.

## Belonging & Meaningful Work
Being a community catalyst, facilitating workshops and experiences, and supporting local businesses and projects to emerge is my **meaningful work**. Doing it locally creates a deep sense of **belonging**. In other words, it's a dream combination ✨.

My personal challenge is to make this work financially sustainable. I invite you to **contribute with a small recurring donation via my [Patreon page](https://patreon.com/michalkorzonek), and/or reach out to work with me on your project**.
