# Connect
We always welcome new connections!

If you're based in the Azores, are interested in relocating here, or want to co-create a sailing route connecting the islands and beyond, check out our long-term vision: [Azores Regenerative Network](/azores-regenerative-network.md).

We'd love to hear from you üê¶.
