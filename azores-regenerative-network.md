# Azores Regenerative Network

Microsolidarity in Pico is the first step on the path towards creating a network of regenerative projects and communities in the Azores.

If you live in the archipelago and would like to connect, get in touch with me via email: michal at journalsmarter dot com

I'm available to co-create events, gatherings, and projects, as well as help with documentation and connecting with other people and projects in the Azores and beyond.

ps. Would you like your project to be listed here? Let me know ☀️
