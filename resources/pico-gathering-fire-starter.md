# Pico Gathering Fire Starter

**This is an internal resource or our congregation, intended to help kick-start the process of our future gatherings by compiling the necessary areas to consider.**

Note, that It's more of a rough guideline, rather than something to stick to religiously.

You can find notes from our Previous Gatherings here:

* [Pico Winter Gathering](../projects/winter-gathering-2020.md), December 2020
* [Pico Summer Gathering](../projects/summer-gathering-2021.md), June 2021 ‚Äì> our first "proper" gathering
* [Pico Autumn Gathering](../projects/autumn-gathering-2021.md), October 2021

Note: it's recommended to read through the retrospective sections of the previous gatherings to get more context on how we arrived at the following guideline.

### Hosting Team

#### Core Hosting Team

Key team of the Gathering, consisted of four people, each with their own area of responsibility: program, food, site. The team also includes the Joker üÉè ‚Äì a person who might not have the confidence to take a role in the core costing team, but is keen on learning the ropes.

Ideally, the team should include 2 people with previous hosting expertise and 2 new people. In order to ensure long-lasting Gatherings, we need to build up a pool of hosts, and there's no other way to learn than by doing.

#### Hosting Team

People involved in creating the Gathering before and/or during the Gathering, usually coordinated by one of the Core Hosts.

#### Helpers

People helping out during the Gathering

### Timeline

Note that the steps don't need to happen in that order.

1. The possible dates are identified during the retrospective of the previous Gathering.
2. One of the core hosts takes the responsibility of calling the new hosting team 3 months before the first date.
3. The Core Hosting Team assembles and decides on the date. A "save the date" message is sent to the participants of the previous gathering.
4. The Core Team picks the venue.
5. The Core Team creates the invitee list. An invite is sent 1,5 months before the gathering, with a cut-off registration time 1 month before the gathering. This will allow the core host responsible for site to ensure the necessary help is sourced.
6. Preparation process. Core hosting team meets whenever necessary.
   * Cooking team assembles. Menu is decided. Ingredients are sourced
   * Program is designed. Involve more people in hosting activities.
   * Site is prepared
7. A participation kit is sent to all the participants
8. Gathering
9. Feedback form is sent to participants
10. Core team meets for a Retrospective. Possible dates for the future gathering are identified, one person takes the responsibility of calling the core hosting team for the next gathering 3 months before the earliest date.
