# Sharing Circle 🌀

We’re focusing on **building emotional proximity before jumping into developing “projects”** together.&#x20;

Our first intentional activity as a group is to gather in a **sharing circle,** and this is where the journey of this community started. You can read about the [first round here](sharing-circle-v1.md).

We keep a rhythm of agreed number of circles followed by a retrospective, as we move through iterations of the circle.

Here are the formats and reflections from each round, with the current circle format on top.
