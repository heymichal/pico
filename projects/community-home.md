# Pico Community Home
This working group emerged from our [Pico Community Spring Gathering 2022](/projects/spring-gathering-2022.md), when it became clear that our community needs a Home.

There is a possibility that the Land where we currently host our events will be available for sale in the fall 2022. We're in the process of raising funds.
