# Gatherings

Our community comes together for a few days during a bi-annual gathering.

You can read the documentation for each of our gathering below:

* [Winter Gathering 2020](winter-gathering-2020.md) - a prototype of a gathering
* [Summer Gathering 2021](summer-gathering-2021.md) - our first "proper" gathering
* [Autumn Gathering 2021](autumn-gathering-2021.md)
- [Spring Gathering 2022](spring-gathering-2022.md)
- [Pico Community Weekend](/articles/pico-community-weekend.md) - a mini-gathering designed for minimal organisational work
