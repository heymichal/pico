# Gatherings

Our community comes together for a few days during a bi-annual gathering.

You can read the documentation for each of our gathering below:

* [Autumn Gathering 2021](autumn-gathering-2021.md)
* [Summer Gathering 2021](summer-gathering-2021.md) (first "proper" gathering)
* [Winter Gathering 2020](winter-gathering-2020.md) (not really a "proper" gathering)

### Resources

[Pico Gathering Fire Starter](../resources/pico-gathering-fire-starter.md) - internal resource for the core hosting team of the gathering.
