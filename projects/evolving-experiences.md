# Evolving Experiences ✨

**A multidisciplinary crew aiming at bringing more variety into cultural scene of Pico, by creating experiences that touch people.**

The idea was seeded during [Pico Summer Gathering](summer-gathering-2021.md). _Evolving Experiences_ is a working name for now.&#x20;

### Now

(what we're focusing on right now)

* Exploring possibilities of managing funds without administrative hassle (looking into [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com) as a possibility)
* Exploring a possibility of starting a cooperative

### Experiences

* Slam Jam, July 2021
* Masking Around, September 2021
* [Pico Autumn Gathering](autumn-gathering-2021.md), September 2021 (co-created with the community)
* The Community Council Game & Jam Session, December 2021&#x20;



Below are the notes from our first meeting.

### Intentions

* Create events / experiences with a purpose deeper than just hanging out.
* Use art as a "magnet" to bring awareness to important issues we're passionate about.
* Create memorable spaces (locations), which play an active role in co-creating experiences.
* Experiment with new, unexpected experience formats, create something people haven't seen before, keep evolving.
* Experiment with new ways of relating to each other.
* Include reflective spaces during experiences, to process, discuss and integrate the experience and its topic (equivalent to _Shavasana_ in Yoga).
* Gradually improve _The Globe_, as we keep using that space for hosting various events.
* Use nature to set up temporary spaces for experiences.
* Explore possibilities of bringing income to fund our activities, and potentially make it a part-time(?) job for (some?) crew members.

### Context

* Keep the work as flexible as possible.&#x20;
* Little meetings, more async work.&#x20;
* Show up on the day and set it up.
* Evenings are usually the best times for all of us to be present.

### Ideas

(Work in progress)

#### Topics / Issues

* Animals
* Rising consciousness
* Community life
* Covid (particularly interesting if we bring people with fundamentally different opinions)
* Making Pico the best place to live on Earth

#### Experiences

* Audio-visual theatre
* Mute event
* Walking disco
* Play reading
* Varieté
* Music improvised to movement (rather that the other way around)
* Dance Party (with a bar vibe)
* Improv
* Films / Projections
* Art exhibition
* Festival (multiday event)
* Costume party

#### Money

* Explore [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com) as a way to manage funds with very little admin work. If not possible, then perhaps start an association (or other legal structure).
  * Michal in conversation with Alina from Open Collective ([documentation of OO](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/about/introduction))
  * [Open Collective Europe](https://opencollective.com/europe) as a potential fiscal host (6% fee, [terms](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cc8GBkH4XUfdF9hxmrK5b2W2YUw09hRNoCMdoR2Kzao/pub))
* Host a fundraising event
* Sell artwork (auction?)
* Host special experiences (eg. birthdays, weddings) as a service
* Find patrons of the arts excited about supporting our work financially

#### Format

* Have two spaces during events (eg. main space + fire) to allow people to move freely and choose the energy they need.
* Experiment with no alcohol / no drugs / no food during experiences. Make a clear and explicit invitation. Make space for events with substances, as both can co-exist peacefully.&#x20;
* Separate our experiences from the regular Jam Sessions (even if the hosting team might be partially the same).

#### Spaces

* The Globe
* Nature (eg. caves, dry rivers, forest, beach...)

### Team

Annia: event planning, organising, hosting, acting\
Austeja: space design, idea generation, performance,\

### Next Steps

Anyone from the team to put an event proposal to the crew.
