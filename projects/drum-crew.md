# Elementals Drum Crew 🥁

We've spent a lot of time during our first [Winter Gathering](winter-gathering-2020.md) playing music (especially drums) together. It turns out that quite a few of us absolutely loved it and there's enough energy to catalyze a drum crew into existence.

After sourcing our drums, we decided to meet weekly to practice.&#x20;

Most of us have never played drums (or any other instruments) before, but it seems we're getting somewhere cool:

At the moment our drum crew has two sections:

* Basses
* Djembes

We also have a snare drum, but we didn't incorporate it yet very well. We'd love to add shakers in the future. We also want to bring more people in. The more drums the better 🥁🥁🥁.
