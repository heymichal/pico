In this section you'll learn about projects within our congregation.

The whole process started with hosting a bi-weekly [sharing circle](sharing-circle/), which lead to sprouting a few projects, and eventually, our [first community gathering](summer-gathering-2021.md).

During our [Autumn Gathering 2021](autumn-gathering-2021.md), we played a game designed to catalyse more projects into existence, which will be reviewed during our next gathering planned for Spring 2022.

You can also see the [Pico Projects Map](../pico-projects-map.md) for other projects in the island.
