# Winter Gathering 2020 ðŸ’™

Since most of us were staying in the island, we decided to have a Winter Gathering spread over a few days during the Christmas / New Year period.&#x20;

We started with brainstorming a few ideas during the announcements section of our [sharing circle](sharing-circle/) and agreed on the initial plan, which then evolved organically in the run up to the gathering.

### Winter Solstice

Celebration of entering the Age of the Aquarius.

### Christmas Day

Delicious food, improv theatre games, live music and "Secret Santa" with hand-made gifts.

Note: we played Secret Santa with a broader community in the island, which was a great way to bring more people in and build connections outside of the circle and spend some quality time as a community.

### Hike in Nature

Exploring one of the numerous trails in Pico.

### Full Moon Fire

Every Full Moon is a great opportunity to have a fire and play some music.

### New Years Eve Party

Dinner and a proper dance party. Here's our (very eclectic) [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2735ANnUAVtRIvjMuRAg3g?si=-2K\_sdOhTJKDe2UdPN3xwg).

### Community Meeting: Retrospective + Next Steps

Reflecting on [the circle](sharing-circle/) and planning our next steps as a community.
