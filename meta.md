# Meta

This website contains the **documentation of microsolidarity work in Pico Island, a first step towards  growing a network of regenerative communities in the Azores.**

### Why?

The intention of this documentation is to **work in public** and **document** **our progress** as it happens. Hopefully it will help to **clarify** what's going on, **inspire others** and help us **get meaningful feedback** to **improve our community work**.

### Who?

This documentation is maintained (with Love) by [Michal Korzonek](https://michalkorzonek.com), and it's my personal perspective on what is happening in Pico, shaped through my community work in the island.\

With that in mind here's an important disclaimer:

**This documentation is **_**not**_** the only perspective on what's happening in Pico, and I'm not perfect, nor am I trying to be.**
