# Microsolidarity in Pico

## This digital journal documents the process of community weaving in Pico Island, by practicing Microsolidarity.

[Microsolidarity](https://www.microsolidarity.cc/) is a community building practice focused on **creating structures for belonging and supporting people into meaningful work.**

> ***Belonging is a superpower**: we‚Äôre more courageous & creative when we "find our people"*. 

In Pico, a fortnightly sharing circle evolved into bi-annual Gatherings, from where numerous projects are constantly emerging. Some of them manifest life-long dreams of their co-creators, others fail due to conflict or lack of energy. That's okay - **we are learning by doing**. 

**Finding our people, a sense of belonging, and co-creating magic, comes along with practicing being together in groups of different sizes, regularly and intentionally.** 

Here's the story of making it happen in a tiny island, not too far from one of the hypothetical locations of the *Atlantis*.

## Long Term Vision ‚ú®
Our long term vision is to co-create **Azores Regenerative Network**, connecting regenerative projects, communities and practitioners in the archipelago. Plus a **fleet of sailboats** crossing in between the islands and the Mainland.

## Open Source Documentation
The intention of this documentation is to **learn by doing** and **work in public**. We're documenting our progress as it happens, with the intention to **clarify what is happening**, **inspire other community weavers**, and **attract meaningful feedback**.

We also have an intention of creating a **magnetic pull bringing more Microsolidarity practitioners into the archipelago**.
