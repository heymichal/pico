# Microsolidarity in Pico

## This website documents the process of weaving a community in Pico Island, by practicing Microsolidarity.

[Microsolidarity](https://www.microsolidarity.cc/) is a community building practice focused on **creating structures for belonging and supporting people into meaningful work.**

> ***Belonging is a superpower**: we’re more courageous & creative when we "find our people"*. (...) You decide what is meaningful (work) to you. *Generally, life is more meaningful when we are **being of benefit to others**, when we know how to contribute, when we can match our talents to the needs in the world.*
> - [Richard Bartlett](https://twitter.com/richdecibels), Microsolidarity

## North Star ✨
Our long term vision is to co-create **Azores Regenerative Network**, connecting regenerative projects, communities and practitioners in the archipelago. Plus a **fleet of sailboats** crossing in between the islands and the Mainland.

## Documentation
The intention of this documentation is to **learn by doing** and **work in public**. We're documenting our progress as it happens, with the intention to **clarify what is happening**, **inspire other community weavers**, and **attract meaningful feedback**.

We also have an intention of creating a **magnetic pull bringing more Microsolidarity practitioners into the archipelago**.
